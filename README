I have an HT-PC running uTorrent and this console app. uTorrent is set to watch a Dropbox folder.

This way I can add any torrent files to Dropbox and they will automatically get loaded into the uTorrent on the HT-PC.

uTorrent has often tried to load files from Dropbox before they have completed syncing, thus crashing this console app. I added a file lock to prevent this.

Also, I don't like having files cluttering up the folder, so I have added an option to delete the *.torrent files after they've been loaded into uTorrent.
